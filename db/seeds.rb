# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ first_name: 'Star Wars' }, { first_name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(first_name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#  Proper seeding with Faker TBD
User.create(first_name: "Paul")
User.create(first_name: "Seb")
User.create(first_name: "Jack")
User.create(first_name: "Henry")
